Monster Fish: final-project-ninaraynor created by GitHub Classroom

This is my first web design project using HTML, CSS, and very basic JavaScript from my undergraduate Computer Graphics course at Binghamton University in 2022. 
Through my love for comics and anime style, I wanted to tell a story that could be easily digested by anyone. "Monster Fish" is a lighthearted tale of what happens when you choose 
to take on the responsibility of caring for a pet without thinking about caring for it in the long run. 
I used Procreate on my iPad to sketch my goldfish and different scenes from my story, and used Photoshop and Illustrator to create animated effects throughout.
